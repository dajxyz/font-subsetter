# Font subsetting for faster web pages

Create a subset font from an existing font in SFNT (TrueType/OpenType), WOFF, or WOFF2 format.

This is a ready-to-use, swap-in-your-filepaths, minimal working example of https://github.com/papandreou/subset-font with some additional comments. 

If you are looking for a one-off, easy to use tool https://github.com/leodeslf/fontima is probably what you need.
